# Poster presentation

**Due Sunday, April 21**  
Submit your poster and replication code electronically on Canvas.

### Overview
This is the third opportunity to highlight your ability to complete an empirical research project as a data analyst. Your task is to ask and answer an empirical question using appropriate data and statistical analysis. The challenge is to present the work in a single poster in a way that is both sophisticated and understandable to a lay audience.


### Poster
Use `Rmarkdown` to create your poster. The final product must include at least the following elements:
- Title
- Author info (name, institution, email, etc)
- Introduction with main question, expectations, and importance
- Method/data: source and brief description (graph and/or summary of key vars)
- Results: use appropriate statistical tests (e.g., multiple regression) to evaluate hypotheses. Should include at least one table and one visual.
- Findings: Answer. Your. Question.

Note that while all of these must be present some of these could be broken up or some merged depending on your question and preferred poster format. 


### Data
You cannot use data from your prior projects. If you're just out of ideas at this point, I'm happy to offer suggestions. Because the work for this assessment requires statistical analysis, you will need enough observations to identify associations (statistical power). Avoid anything with fewer than 100 observations.

### Expectations
I will evaluate the poster for quality, including readability of text, excellence and consistency of visualizations, accuracy/validity of analysis, and demonstration that you can use data to ask and answer a question.
